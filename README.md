# STORMLite
Code for a super-resolution microscope simulator, made to reflect upon the stochastic process STORM uses to reconstruct specimens at the nano-scale level.

Features:

- Full control of Charlieplexed array and PiCamera
- Simple GUI for users to interact with
- 2D Recursive collapsing method for stochastic imaging process
- (planned) 3D Recursive stacking/collapsing method for stochastic imaging process
- (planned) overclocking of computer CPU to increase computational workload

Requirements:

- Raspberry Pi 2.0 or later with at 8 GB of disk space and 1 GB RAM
- PiCamera 2.0
- Python 2.70 or later
